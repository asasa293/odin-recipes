        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaguetti</li>
            <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>Tomato paste</li>
            <li>Peperoncino</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Sliced garlic</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve a cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, heat a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta and cook until it starts to render its fat and become crispy.</li>
            <li>In a separate large skillet, heat a couple of tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet in a single layer. Allow it to cook without stirring for a few minutes until it starts to develop a golden-brown crust on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Using tongs or a spatula, carefully flip sections of the spaghetti to evenly toast the other side. Be cautious as the spaghetti may splatter.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking the spaghetti, flipping occasionally, until it is evenly golden and crispy on the outside while still tender on the inside. This step adds a unique texture and flavor to the dish.</li>
            <li>Once the spaghetti is toasted to your liking, proceed with the original recipe by adding it to the skillet with the sauce and tossing to combine.</li>
            <li>Serve the spaghetti all'assassina hot, garnished with grated pecorino romano cheese and chopped fresh parsley.</li>
        </ol>
