    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (480ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or other flavorings of your choice)</li>
        <li>Extra granulated sugar for caramelizing the tops</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Place a kettle or pot of water on the stove to boil for the water bath.</li>
        <li>Prepare Ramekins: Arrange your ramekins in a baking dish. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat Cream: In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it just begins to simmer. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk Egg Yolks: In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well combined and slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Temper the Eggs: Slowly pour the hot cream into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to temper the eggs. This prevents them from scrambling.</li>
        <li>Add Flavoring: Stir in the vanilla extract or other flavorings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Strain Mixture: For a smoother custard, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl.</li>
        <li>Fill Ramekins: Pour the custard mixture evenly into the prepared ramekins.</li>
        <li>Create Water Bath: Carefully pour hot water into the baking dish around the ramekins, being careful not to splash water into the custards. The water should come about halfway up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
        <li>Bake: Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still jiggles slightly when gently shaken.</li>
        <li>Chill: Remove the ramekins from the water bath and allow them to cool to room temperature. Then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until well chilled.</li>
        <li>Caramelize Sugar: Just before serving, sprinkle a thin, even layer of granulated sugar over the surface of each custard. Use a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar until golden and bubbly. If you don't have a torch, you can also use the broiler in your oven.</li>
        <li>Serve: Let the crème brûlée sit for a minute or two to allow the caramelized sugar to harden, then serve immediately and enjoy your delicious dessert!</li>
    </ol>
