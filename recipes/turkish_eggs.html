    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika (preferably smoked)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish</li>
        <li>Turkish bread or crusty bread, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing the yogurt sauce. In a mixing bowl, combine the Greek yogurt with the minced garlic and a pinch of salt. Stir well until smooth and creamy. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the paprika and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir briefly to infuse the oil with the spices, being careful not to burn them.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is fragrant, remove the saucepan from the heat and set it aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a medium-sized pot of water to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Crack each egg into a small bowl or ramekin.</li>
        <li>Using a spoon, create a gentle whirlpool in the simmering water. Carefully slide one egg into the center of the whirlpool. Repeat with the remaining eggs, working quickly but carefully.</li>
        <li>Poach the eggs for about 3-4 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the poached eggs from the water and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess water.</li>
        <li>To assemble the Turkish eggs, spread a generous layer of garlic yogurt on individual serving plates.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the poached eggs on top of the yogurt sauce.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the paprika-infused olive oil over the eggs and yogurt.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and an extra sprinkle of red pepper flakes, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve the Turkish eggs immediately with Turkish bread or crusty bread for dipping and scooping up the creamy yogurt and runny egg yolks.</li>
      </ol>
